Apache-LangPrefCookie version 1.00
==================================
DESCRIPTION

This module looks for a cookie providing a language-code as its value.
This preference is then implanted into httpd's representation of the
Accept-Language header, just as if the client had asked for it as #1
choice. The original preferences are still present, albeit with lowered
q-values. The cookie's name is configurable, as described in the
examples. Setting/modifying/deleting such a cookie is to be handled
separately, Apache::LangPrefCookie just consumes it.

After that, it's up to httpd's mod_negotiation to choose the best
deliverable representation.
